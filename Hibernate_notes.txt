Driver - convert one application called to another application who provide [e.g:usb]
jdbc api: Java Database Connectivity  
		 --->	which has inbuilt method for driver interface /class
		 --->	who provide this api [ database vendor implemnted this]
		 
		What is Difference Between Statement Vs PreparedStatement Vs CallableStatement In Java JDBC
		
		CallableStatement
				this is precompiled  statement use to call store procedure
		PreparedStatement (this is alway faster)
				precompiled statement use to fire dynamic query which accept the data at the runtime 
		Statement
				Statement are use for simple query execution

What Is JDBC?
JDBC – Java Database Connectivity API which is used by the java application to interact with the database.
JDBC API makes java application almost independent of the database it uses.
If your application is using JDBC API to interact with the database, then you need not to change much in your code each time you change the database of your application. You can switch easily from one database to another.

JDBC API provides some sort of standardization on how to establish a connection with the database, how to send the queries to the database, how to navigate the results returned by the database and how to update a database. Java application, JDBC API and Database can be schematically represented as below.

JDBC API not directly interacts with the database. It uses JDBC driver of that database to interact with the database.

What Are JDBC Drivers?
JDBC driver is a software component which is required by the JDBC API to interact with the database. Each database will have their own JDBC driver. This driver is supplied by the database vendor along with the database.
 For example, JDBC driver of Oracle 10G is ojdbc14.jar and it will be available in Oracle installation directory at …/Oracle/app/oracle/product/10.2.0/server/jdbc/lib.

	--semicompleete reusable comoponant which is used to remove boiler plate code and help us to optimize application 
	devlopment process

#ORM[Object/Relational Mapping]

 
 it is concept of Object-Relational Mapping which fouced on obj rather than table and maps the obj and its property to the 
 specific table and its column
 
 #JPA 
	It is  Java Persistence API based on ORM concept which provides you set of inbuilt
	interface class method to perform database opretion using ORM
	
	{In addition to its own "native" API, Hibernate is also an implementation of the Java Persistence API (JPA) specification.
	As such, it can be easily used in any environment supporting JPA including Java SE applications, 
	Java EE application servers, Enterprise OSGi containers, etc }
 
 hibernet is a open source which implements JPA to perform ORM and various db opretion
 
 what is dialate
	it is used to convert sql query to hibernet queries and vice-varsa
	

  <property name="hbm2ddl.auto">create</property>
       it will create every time new table 
 
 poolsize =5; at a time 5 connection to the 
 xml mapping
 <mapping resource ="customer.hbm.xml"/> //xml mapping
				or
 <mapping class= "com.lnt.day18_hibernet.customer.model"/> //annotation mapping
